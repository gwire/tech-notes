# macOS notes

Personal gripes/bugs/wishlist for macOS software.

## App Store

* When the update prompt appears it has the options "now, in an hour, later" but I always want to see what's being updated first. So I choose "in an hour", then manually update, then (an hour later) get an error message about a failed update.

## iTunes

## Finder

* I almost always want Finder windows to be an icon view with auto-snap-to-grid and to reflow to window width. Currently not supported.

## Lanchpad

* Ordering of items will randomly change after updates, and sometimes after reboots.

## Mail

* The number count for Flagged mails is usually inaccurate.
* The "All Headers" message view is unreadable - changes the header order and the formatting makes it hard to parse.
* Shared and Public mailfolders keep falsely popping up in the unread count in the Mailboxes sidebar and then dissapearing.

## Numbers

* Cannot open ODS files.

## Safari

* Via "Manage Website Data" there's often a database that will spontaneously reappear in the list after being removed. (Needs to be deleted via `~/Library/Safari/Databases` )
